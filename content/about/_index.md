OpenWayback was the Java-based replay engine maintained by the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) and partner institutions. It powered the Wayback Machine experience for many archives worldwide.

> **Status:** OpenWayback is no longer under active development. IIPC recommends migrating to [pywb](https://github.com/Webrecorder/pywb), which offers higher fidelity replay and an actively maintained codebase. See the [pywb transition guide](https://pywb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/owb-transition.html).

## Key features

- Replay archived web content using the classic Wayback interface
- Support for ARC/WARC collections
- Configurable access points (proxy mode, Memento endpoints, custom replay UIs)
- Extensible Spring-based configuration and WAR overlay support

## Maintainers & community

- Project maintainers: Daniel Weitzner, Gordon Mohr, and contributors from IIPC member organisations
- Governance: [International Internet Preservation Consortium](https://netpreserve.org/)
- Source: [github.com/iipc/openwayback](https://github.com/iipc/openwayback)
